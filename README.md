# Based Design Theory


This project is based on "Combinatorial Design Theory" 

I have taken a class on it and I wanted to make this project with some of the cool concepts I have learned.

Some of the concepts include:
Stiner Triple Systems
Latin Squares
Starters (Especially focused on Hamilton Starters)
Maybe more stuff in the future


Still very much a work in progress


## To Run
Make sure rust is installed on your system

Once you have rustup/cargo run 

```cargo run```
